1. Read and rearrange the data

2. checked the central tendency
  . mean 
  . median 
  . mode
  . percentile
  .std
3. find skewness & kurtosis for each day

4. seperated week 5 and 6 data as the difficulty level has increased so the pattern of the marks for a particular student also changed.

6. checked the central tendency
  . mean 
  . median 
  . mode
  . percentile
  .std
  . find skewness & kurtosis for each day
  
 7. checked the values for sigma upto +,- 3
 
 8 checked the variance for each day 
  M5     3.032533
  T5     3.129801
  W5     2.695206
  TH5    2.048364
  F5     1.463864
  M6     2.986202
  T6     2.361168
  W6     1.686578
  TH6    1.897606
  F6     2.215600
  
 9. checked the distibution using histo gram
 10. checked the basic statical description using box plot
 
 11. imputthe missing values using knn imputer
   n_neighbors=2, weights="uniform
   
   got comparision ccuracy = 61.9
   
   MAE 0.46320000000000006
   MSE 2.5957999999999997
   RMSE 1.6111486585663037
   
 12. plot the imputed data and checked the difference in distribution
     . find that the distribution remains same
     . compare the skewness and kutosis 
     . find the new sigma for upto +,- 3
     
     
 13. predicted the next week data
     for prediction we use Vector auto regression
     
     . first predict with the train set 
     . And then predict with whole data
     . also tries to predict with last previous weeks(but found no change in prediction so drop that)
     
     . we got accuracy == 70.31(while comparing with previous data)
     . MSE  = 5.65
     . checked the skewness and kurtosis
     . plot different types of graphs (box, histo grams )
     
 THE END
